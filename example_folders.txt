# Example configuration file for plot-costs
# Each line should contain a path to a folder containing .xlsx files
# Optionally, you can specify settings per folder:
#   folder_path [projection_end_date] [year_start_month]
# Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored
# Settings in the config file override command-line defaults

# Examples:
# /path/to/folder1
# /path/to/folder2 2027-12-31 7
# /path/to/folder3 7
# /path/to/folder4 2028-06-30

# Replace these paths with your actual folder paths:
# /path/to/your/first/folder
# /path/to/your/second/folder
# /path/to/your/third/folder
